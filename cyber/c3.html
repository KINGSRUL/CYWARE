        <h2>1.Strong Passwords </h2>
        <p>Avoid using easily guessable passwords like "123456" or "password." Create strong, unique passwords for each account, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Use a password manager to generate and securely store complex passwords, reducing the risk of password-related breaches.</p>

Verify the senderâ€™s information, and if unsure, contact the organization directly before responding to such messages.</p>

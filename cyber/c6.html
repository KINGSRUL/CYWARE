        <p>Essential cybersecurity practices tailored for businesses.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1.Implement Strong Access Control </h2>
        <p>Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to systems and data based on an employeeâ€™s role within the company. Enforce the principle of least privilege (PoLP), granting users only the access they need to perform their job functions. Regularly review and update access rights to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>2.Adopt Multi Factor Authentication(MFA)</h2>
        <p>MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to access systems. This can include passwords, one-time codes, biometrics, or security tokens. Implementing MFA across all critical systems reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.</p>

        <h2>3.Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan (IRP)</h2>
        <p>An IRP outlines the steps to take in the event of a cyber incident, detailing roles, communication strategies, and response steps. Regularly testing the IRP through drills or tabletop exercises prepares the team to respond effectively and minimizes the potential damage from attacks.</p>

        <h2>4.Secure Cloud Configurations and Implement Zero Trust</h2>
        <p>For businesses using cloud services, secure configurations are essential. Follow cloud provider security best practices, configure access controls carefully, and monitor for misconfigurations. Implementing a Zero Trust model, where verification is required for each request, helps protect sensitive data and applications.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5.Monitor and Log Network Activity</h2>
        <p>Implement logging and monitoring tools to track network and user activity in real-time. Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to aggregate and analyze log data, identifying suspicious patterns that could indicate potential attacks. Regular monitoring can help detect and respond to threats early.</p>

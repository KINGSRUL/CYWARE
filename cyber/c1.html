        <p>Understanding various types of cyber attacks, including how they work and how to protect against them.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Phishing Attacks</h2>
        <p>Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers pose as legitimate entities, like banks or popular websites, to trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data. They typically use deceptive emails, messages, or websites that look genuine. Phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and compromised accounts.</p>

        <h2>2. Malware</h2>
        <p>Malware, short for "malicious software," includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and more. These programs infiltrate devices to steal data, spy on users, or damage the system. Ransomware, for example, locks users out of their files until a ransom is paid. Malware attacks are common and can be delivered through infected files, email attachments, or malicious websites.</p>

        <h2>3. DDoS Attacks</h2>
        <p>In DoS attacks, an attacker floods a network or server with excessive requests, overwhelming it and causing it to crash or become unavailable to users. A DDoS attack takes this a step further by using multiple computers to launch a more powerful attack. These attacks disrupt services, harm business operations, and may even cause financial loss due to downtime..</p>

        <h2>4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h2>
        <p>MitM attacks occur when a hacker intercepts the communication between two parties to steal data or inject malicious code. Common in public Wi-Fi settings, attackers can eavesdrop on sensitive conversations, login credentials, or financial transactions. This attack compromises confidentiality and can lead to further exploitation of sensitive data.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>5. SQL Injection</h2>
        <p>SQL injection targets databases through vulnerable applications by inserting malicious SQL code into input fields. This allows attackers to access, manipulate, or delete data in the database without authorization. SQL injection attacks can be damaging to businesses, as attackers may expose or alter confidential information stored within the database.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>6.Zero-Day exploits</h2>
        <p>A zero-day attack occurs when cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in software or hardware that are unknown to the vendor. Since no patch or fix is available, these attacks are challenging to prevent and can lead to significant data breaches. Attackers often use zero-day vulnerabilities to target government organizations, corporations, or critical infrastructure.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>7.Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
        <p>Social engineering manipulates individuals into revealing confidential information or performing actions that benefit the attacker. Techniques include impersonation, baiting, pretexting, and phishing. By exploiting human psychology, social engineering attacks bypass technical security measures, making them one of the hardest attacks to detect.</p>
